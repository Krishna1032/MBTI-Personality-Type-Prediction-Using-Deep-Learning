    "I came across a post on devopsdigest.com and need your input: “70% DevOps organizations Unhappy with DevOps Monitoring Tools”\n",
    "In a similar investigation I found out that many DevOps organizations use several monitoring tools in parallel. Senu, Nagios, LogStach and SaaS offerings such as DataDog or SignalFX to name a few. However, one element is missing: Consolidation of alerts and status in a single pane of glass, which enables fast remediation of application and infrastructure uptime and performance issues.\n",
    "Sure, there are commercial tools on the market for exactly this use case but these tools are not necessarily optimized for DevOps.\n",
    "So, here my question to you: In your DevOps project, have you encountered that the lack of consolidation of alerts and status is a real issue? If yes, how did you approach the problem? Or is an ChatOps approach just right?\n",
    "You will probably hear more and more about ChatOps - at conferences, DevOps meet-ups or simply from your co-worker at the coffee station. ChatOps is a term and concept coined by GitHub. It's about the conversation-driven development, automation, and operations.\n",
    "Now the question is: why and how would I, as an ops-focused engineer, implement and use ChatOps in my organization? The next question then is: How to include my tools into the chat conversation?\n",
    "Let’s begin by having a look at a use case. The Closed Looped Incidents Process (CLIP) can be rejuvenated with ChatOps. The work from the incident detection runs through monitoring until the resolution of issues in your application or infrastructure can be accelerated with improved, cross-team communication and collaboration.\n",

An Infrastructure as a Service platform such as HP Helion Public Cloud Compute is a great place to quickly spin-up a Linux server and install HP Operations Manager i for various use scenarios. An example of a good use case is monitoring workloads across public clouds such as AWS and Azure.\n",
